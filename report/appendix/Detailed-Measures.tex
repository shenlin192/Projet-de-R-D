Lengthy sub-results have to be put in appendices.  In other words, too boring details should be postponed to the very last part of the reading, that is when the reader is interested enough in understanding the very details of your proposal, especially if he or she intend to reproduce your experiment.  This is also true for detailed algorithms, etc.

This (these) appendix(ces) is (are) mandatory in order for the report to contain of the ``proofs'' of its claims, i.e., to really provide a \emph{scientific} work.
