# Tasks done:
I have studied the concepts and principles of C++ compilation this week and I've got a much deeper understanding of different phases of C++ compilation. At the same time, I've started to rewrite the report on the parts of preprocessor and compiler.   

# Tasks preview:
1. Continue to read books, documents and all other relative articles on C++ compilation.
Especially the subject of assembler and link editor (static link, dynamic link).

2. Finish chapters of preprocessor and compiler of the report and move on to chapters of assembler and link editor.
