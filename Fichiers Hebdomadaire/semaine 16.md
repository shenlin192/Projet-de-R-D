I haven't work on the project this week because I'm very nervous about my internship.
I had several interviews before and I thought it's very possible that at least one offer
can be obtained. However, all that I've got are reject letters.

The only meaningful things on the project is my exchange with the professor.

look for an internship

So sad this week.
