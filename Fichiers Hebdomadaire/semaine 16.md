# Tasks done:
I haven't work on the project this week because I'm very nervous about my internship.
I had several interviews before and I thought it's very possible that at least one offer
can be obtained. However, all that I've got are reject letters. So I looked for internships,
prepare interviews and do the tests of companies all the week as long as I am free.

The only meaningful things on the project is my exchange with my professor this Friday.
We have decided to move on to Clang AST

# Tasks preview:
