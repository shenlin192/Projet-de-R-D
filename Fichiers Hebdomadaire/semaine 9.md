# Tasks done:
The soutenance is finished this week. But after some exchanges with the professor,  we have found out that there are some concepts needed to be further explained in my report. Moreover, due to my lack of understanding of C++ compilation, I can't explain clearly the big picture of our project during soutenance. Therefore, a great deal of learning on C++ compilation as well as modifications on the report is needed.

# Tasks preview:
1. Read the handbook "Tool Interface Standard (TIS)
Executable and Linking Format (ELF)
Specification"
2. Read the book "Linkers and loaders"
3. Read other documentations, articles, blogs on C++ compilation
