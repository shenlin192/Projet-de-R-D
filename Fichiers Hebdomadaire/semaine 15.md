# Tasks done:
Finally, the chapter of C++ compilation is finished as well as the part of JavaScript.
Since I've already spent a lot of time on my report, I need to come back to the code.
So I look through all the experiments that I did for this project and add documentations as
well as comments for each of them. Moreover, as the original code structure is messy, I've
rewritten a cmake file to reorganize the entire project.
Lastly, I tried to use DGtal from nodeJs and successfully draw some points using JavaScript.

The problem is, in order to invoke functions of DGtal, I need to write a wrapper for those functions
that I want to use I JavaScript. However, ideally, I should be able to invoke DGtal functions directly.   

# Tasks preview:
1. Tell my professor the progress
2. Continue to work on DGtal
