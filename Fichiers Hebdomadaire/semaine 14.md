# Tasks done:
I've spent a lot of time in writing the report this week. In order to illustrate each step of C++  
compilation as clearly as possible, I've collected numbers of pictures.
Moreover, many simple but concrete examples are given. There are so many things needed to be explained
in the chapter of link editor. I've just finished the part of "static link".
Ideally, explanation of C++ compilation in my report can be finished next week.  

# Tasks preview:

1. Same as the previous weeks, keep reading books and documents on C++ compilation.
Key points for the next week are "dynamic link" and some C++ features (template, virtual function, Overloading...)

2. Finish the entire part of C++ compilation of my report.

3. Start to study the mechanism of JavaScript, if possible, finish the report of this part.

4. Come back to the code and do some experiments.
